        "### Automate Your Billing Workflow with the Stripe Agent Toolkit and OpenAI Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "Running a service business means juggling two things at once: doing the work and getting paid for it. For a solo electrician or small field service operation, that second part — turning a completed job into a sent invoice — can mean switching between tools, manually entering line items, and chasing down customer records. This cookbook demonstrates how to automate that entire workflow using the OpenAI Agents SDK and the Stripe Agent Toolkit. Rather than building a single monolithic agent, we'll take a multi-agent approach — designing a small team of specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct part of the workflow, coordinated by an orchestrator that routes work between them automatically.\n",
        "Our workflow handles three core tasks end-to-end:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Account lookup**: Identifying the customer by email.\n",
        "* **Quote generation**: Building an itemized quote from a service catalog.\n",
        "* **Invoicing**: Creating and finalizing a billable invoice in Stripe.\n",
        "\n",
        "The [Stripe Agent Toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/agents) is central to this workflow. It provides a set of pre-built, agent-ready tools that connect directly to the Stripe API — covering customers, products, prices, and invoices — without requiring you to write any integration code. Paired with a restricted API key, you can enforce least-privilege permissions so the agent only has access to exactly what it needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this cookbook, a single natural language message like *\"Create an invoice for john@example.com for installing a ceiling fan, which took 2 hours\"* will trigger a fully automated pipeline that looks up the customer, prices the job, and returns a finalized Stripe invoice URL — ready to send.\n",

        "In this cookbook we've demonstrated how the OpenAI Agents SDK and Stripe Agent Toolkit can work together to automate a complete billing workflow — from customer lookup to finalized invoice — triggered by a single natural language message. [The Stripe Agent Toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/agents) does the heavy lifting on the payments side, providing pre-built, agent-ready tools for the full invoicing lifecycle without requiring any custom Stripe integration code. Paired with a restricted API key and a focused set of permissions, it's a pattern that's straightforward to extend — swap in additional Stripe resources, grow the service catalog, or add new specialist agents as your business needs evolve.\n"
